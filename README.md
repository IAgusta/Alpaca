## About Alpaca
  Alpaca or Alpa/Alfa Path Academy is an educational project purpose for educationg young generations, right now this project is solely for my last year assigment on computer engineering but i hope to continiue developing this project into a functional website.
  
  Maybe u will questioning why the computer engineering making a complicated website for the final year project, i just feels if i graduate only with simple projects as they are, and nothing special. i will wasted my tutition colagge that gifted by national goverment (KIP). So i make this instead.

  the purpose for this web at first is only for monitoring an esp32 and for module study for elementary student for SD 1 Adzkia Padang, but i've got some troublesome idea's. what about making a complex website that have e-learning like, monitoring system, and controlling system on it. so my final years not become waste. and here it is.

  But thanks to Documentation and help from ChatGPT and Deepseek AI (sometimes the documentations doesnt help) i dont need to study from zero to building this project. Thanks who ever that make the documentation and train the AI i appreciate you.

## Feature on Alpaca
  Like i said before we have an elearning system that having course, module, and the content on it. we have login with email verification,
  some plugins and API for monitorings your lovely kids on studying the course or the robots.

## Note
  This project still need to development futher, so don't judge to much.
  Because my major is not a computer science, but computer engineering instead *+*
